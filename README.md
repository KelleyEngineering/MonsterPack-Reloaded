# MonsterPack-Reloaded

A recreation of Monsterpack for 1.12.2, made for the Stressmonster101 community.
This pack has a heavy emphasis on exploration.

Monsterpack: Reloaded (MP:R) is essentially the same pack updated for 1.12.2 with a massive emphasis on exploration.
Here are the big differences between Monsterpack and MP:R

1. No Mining dimension, we're using Caverns II instead.
- Dangerous dimensions. Not for the unprepared.
- Unique leveling system while in Caverns Dimensions
- Rewards given for manual mining
2. Advanced Rocketry replaced with Galacticraft since it's more "complete"
3. Twilight Forest added to the pack.
4. Loot bags added. They are more rare than other packs usually do it.
- Common Lootbags only drop from passive mobs
- Legendary Bags only drop from Boss mobs
- All other LootBags drop from Hostile mobs
5. Silent's Gems is in the pack.
6. Silent Gear is in the pack
- Armor manually removed from it since textures aren't done.
7. The Nether is a wicked place. NetherEX was added. 
- There are "villagers" in the Nether called Pigcificates. They can be traded with.
8. The Overworld caves have been altered and are more fun to explore.
9. Dungeon Tactics is added
- A lot of Armor and Tools come with this mod
- Effect flowers. Be wary of them.
10. Dynamic Trees make the world look beautiful.
- There is limited support for BoP trees. Not all BoP trees will be dynamic.
